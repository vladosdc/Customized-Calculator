## Customized Calculator

### Stack: JavaScript, CSS, HTML.



Don't like the color of the button or do you prefer an anime theme?
So customize the calculator however you want!

I want to make it so that you can customize almost anything in the calculator.
Choose a theme or color for the interface, like an anime theme or a dark theme, or you just want to make the calculator an orange color, so do it!
Create your own customized calculator interface for yourself!
